# ADT / Classes Repository

This repository contains implementations of common Abstract Data Types (ADT) and classes in C++. The current implementations include:

1. **Priority Queue**: A thread-safe priority queue that allows multiple threads to push and pop elements based on priority.
2. **Linked List**: A simple linked list implementation with append and display functionality.

## Folder Structure

- `PriorityQueue/`: Contains the implementation of a thread-safe priority queue.
- `LinkedList/`: Contains the implementation of a basic singly linked list.

## Usage

### Priority Queue
To compile and run the priority queue example:
```bash
cd PriorityQueue
make
./priority_queue

cd LinkedList
make
./linked_list
